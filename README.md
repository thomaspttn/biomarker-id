This is the repo for the CSDS 458 Introduction to Bioinformatics Final Project. For this project, we trained and tested 10 machine learning algorithms on a publicly available dataset containing biological data on breast cancer patients. We trained and tested on the entire dataset to predict patient survivability. We also trained and tested on 3 subsets to determine if the mutated genes could be used as potential biomarkers for determining patient survivability.
 
The data folder contains the original datasets and normalized datasets that we created and used for our models. There are about 10 genetic datasets in the folder, but we only ended up using results from the 3 most frequently occurring mutations across the patients, which were the PIK3CA, TP53, and CIDH1 genes. The normalized datasets were created using the utils.py file, which converted the dataset text to floats and normalized the results. Our classifier models are in the dl-classifier folder. The main_nn.py file contains the TensorFlow neural network, while the multiple_classifiers.py contains the scikit learn classifiers.
 
The datasets that we used were obtained through the following link: https://www.cbioportal.org/study/clinicalData?id=brca_metabric
